# Business Requirements
- BR1: Increase website interactivity to serve as the basis for musically-inclined or music-loving cancer patients to form a community.
    - Explanation: This is for a non-profit so the project isn’t motivated by a desire to generate profit or a service/etc., but rather a “pet project” desire to create a community for people who have been affected in similar ways as the client, to develop connections and to find support.
