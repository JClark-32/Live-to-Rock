- BR1: To allow for users to build a community for musically-inclined or music-loving cancer patients by increasing website interactivity and useability.
    - Explanation: This is for a non-profit so the project isn’t motivated by a desire to generate profit or a service/etc., but rather a “pet project” desire to create a community for people who have been affected in similar ways as the client, to develop connections and to find support.
