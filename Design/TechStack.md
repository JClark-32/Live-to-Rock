Html, CSS, Javascript
[YT API](https://developers.google.com/youtube), Some [Soundcloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide)/[Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) API
Database
SQL, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

Reasons for why? <br />
Due to the project being a website, Html, CSS, Javascript will all be used.
One of the pages involves Youtube videos which will be interacted with via the Youtube API.
Another one of the pages will deal with podcasts, so either the Soundcloud or Spotify API would be most sutable for the job.
In the discovery meeting we discovered that the prior database for logins and emails is through SQL.
Node.js and JQuery will make the website building process more streamlined.
