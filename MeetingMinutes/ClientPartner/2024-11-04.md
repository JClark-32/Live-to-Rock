## Topics Discussed

- Demonstration of iteration 1 features
- Clarification and explanation of features and work-in-progress
- Second iteration features

## Feedback

- Make sure videos can't be spammed (admin approval)
- Approves of future iteration features (user manuals, approval processes, etc.)

## Things Clarified

Feedback received from client:
- Some sort of notification (email preferred but not necessary) to notify client when video submissions are waiting on approval/rejection (for later iteration when we implement approval for video submission)
- Make sure everything is easy for a non-techy person to manage (FAQ, guide, etc.)
- Okay to update plugins, but make sure the updates aren't "upgrades" that will charge client money
