    My experience at the student symposium was very memorable. I was able to look at the other posters at the event outside of the CS projects and the research was very interesting to learn about. It was also easy to present to the people that came to our station, since most of them weren't very experienced in computer coding and how everything worked. Overall, I really enjoyed getting to share our project with others and see how interested in they were in the mission of LiveToRock.

    My experience at the symposium was good. I was there for the first hour before I had to go to class so I didn't get the full symposium experience as it wasn't very busy to start out. I did end up coming back during the finishing cerimonies and speeches and it was cool to hear about the other projects around the university. For the time I was there it was cool to be able to show off our hard work and see how people react to it.
