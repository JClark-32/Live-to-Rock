## Data Management

### Entries:

Summary: This page allows you to view the entries that have been pushed to the database in a given day. It also allows you to edit and delete entries that may not be accurate. Each entry has 7 pieces of data. They are:

-   Boarded: This is how many people got on the bus.
    
-   Stop: This is the stop that the driver was at for this entry.
    
-   Time: This is the date and time that the entry was made by the driver.
    
-   Date: This is the date of when the data was able to reach the server. (It is important to note that the date from time, and the date from Date may be different. This can be caused if there was an issue with an internet connection and the data was synced on a different day than it was submitted.)
    
-   Loop: This is the loop that the driver was on for this entry.
    
-   Driver: This is the driver for this entry.
    
-   Left Behind: This is how many people were left behind at the stop.
