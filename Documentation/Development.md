    - This should be able to be accessed through any browser.

- Within the editor, the main area we're focusing on is in the plugins.
    - Time.ly handles the calendar widget on the website.
    - User Registration handles the user's ability to create an account on the server.
    - Akismet handles the anti-spam protection for the website.

- There is also the User section, this will allow us to edit the user's roles and access to different parts of the site.

- On the areas of the editor, the "Pages" section will let us see all the pages of the website and allow us to edit them.

- There is an area on the main page of the editor called "Staging" which allows us to make a feature branch for the website to build on.
